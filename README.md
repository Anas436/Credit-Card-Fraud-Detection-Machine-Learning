# ${Omdena \space Munich \space Credit \space Card \space Fraud \space Detection}$

UPDATE: The project is ongoing.

* [Website] TBD
* [Demonstration] TBD

## ${Problem \space Statement}$
Credit card fraud stands as a pervasive and concerning challenge in the realm of financial security. With the increasing reliance on electronic transactions, various types of credit card fraud, such as card-not-present fraud, account takeover, and identity theft, have emerged.

These malicious activities compromise individuals' financial well-being, disrupt business operations, and erode consumer trust. The repercussions encompass financial losses, damaged credit scores, legal complexities, and the arduous process of reclaiming one's identity.

In this landscape, developing robust fraud detection mechanisms becomes paramount, employing cutting-edge technologies to preemptively identify fraudulent activities, curbing the multifaceted impacts of this illicit practice.


## ${Project \space Goal}$
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model for classifying financial transactions (fraudulant, non fraudulant) with a high accuracy (90%).

## ${Project \space API}$
The best performing model will be deployed.

Link: TBD
