This dataset was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.
And then the Kaggle's user KARTIK SHENOY was generated transactions across all profiles and then merged them together to create a more realistic representation of simulated transactions.
